# commandline-learning-environment
CoLE - a command-line environment / pseudo-honeypot for educational purposes, [initially published](https://redmine.fsmpi.rwth-aachen.de/projects/lls/repository/revisions/master/changes/student/student02/studentrc) as part of the [Linux Learning Server](https://redmine.fsmpi.rwth-aachen.de/projects/lls/repository/revisions/master/entry/notes.org) under the umbrella of [OSAK](https://www.fsmpi.rwth-aachen.de/fachschaft/arbeitsgemeinschaften/osak/ "Workgroup for Open Source"), a collaborative effort between members of [ALUG](http://alug.de), [Aachen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aachen)'s Linux User Group and the [Student Body Representatives](https://www.fsmpi.rwth-aachen.de/fachschaft) of [Faculty I/1 Mathematics, Physics & Computer Science "FSMPI"](https://www.fsmpi.rwth-aachen.de) at [https://www.rwth-aachen.de](RWTH Aachen University). 

Prototype version; please apologize use of German language in the initial project!

NOTE: Be aware that this most likely *not* a very strong concept of a honey-pot as it hasn't been pentested / audited *at all*. In fact, if you find a way to break out of this, please let us know!
